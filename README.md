ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION:
1.RSA(Asymmetric key)
2.AES(Symmetric key)
* Asks to select one of the above two algorithms.
* Encryption: Reads a file, encrypts it using the chosen algorithm, stores the encrypted message in another file and creates a file that contains the key.
* Decryption: Reads an encrypted file and the corresponding key file, decrypts it using the same algorithm that created this file and stores the decrypted message in another file.
